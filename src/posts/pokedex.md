Seems everyone has to make a PokÃ©dex App when learning about React and using API's. Know why? Becuase it's super fun!!! So here is mine!

Not only did I learn A TON! This is one of the first times I am proud of the styling. I looked up hex values for the colors of the Pokemon logo and tried to use those where I could. The App has pagination, a search function, and will have (or does have depending on when you read this) filtering Pokemon by type. I think once I do that maybe I will try and figure out some CSS for color themes based on the type or something ðŸ¤”

UPDATE: 08/14/2021 I am building the same applicaion in Svelte for comparison and so far it seems to be 67.86% easier! Once the app is completed and published I will have a link to both as well as the source code for comparison.
