## {title}

I was asked to create a very simple blog site where updates regarding a long term project could be posted. The requirements were that it be simple to use, fast to load, and allow users to add blog posts without assitance. I opted for a Gatsby site with Sanity as the CMS.

See the project <a href="https://hanahanparks.com">here</a>
