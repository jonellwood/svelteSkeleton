<h1>About me and my Dog</h1>
<article>
  <p>
    I currently work as network administrator - slash anything involving a computer - for a great organization. During my time I have been able to develop a little bit of skill in at least a hundred areas related to tech. It is that which brought me to the joy and pain that is JavaScript. I have been able to apply what I have learned to save my employer money, provide a value added service to customers, or often times both.

    I hope to one day have the experience and skills to move into a full time web development role where I can work on improving that specific skill set full time.
