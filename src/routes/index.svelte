<h1>Welcome to my site</h1>

  <p>I want to become a big boy web dev one day. I am interesting in anything related to JavaScript and any tech around it. I am self taught - although I never cared for that term as I feel it does not give credit to content creators that I have learned from. I devour as much information and knowledge as I can to improve my skills.
