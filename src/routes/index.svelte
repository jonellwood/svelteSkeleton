<h2>Welcome to my site</h2>
<article class="p-3">
  <p>I want to become a big boy web dev one day. I am interesting in anything related to JavaScript and any tech around it. I am self taught - although I never cared for that term as I feel it does not give credit to content creators that I have learned from. I devour as much information and knowledge as I can to improve my skills.

    I currently work as network administrator - slash anything involving a computer - for a great organization. During my time I have been able to develop a little bit of skill in at least a hundred areas related to tech. It is that which brought me to the joy and pain that is JavaScript. I have been able to apply what I have learned to save my employer money, provide a value added service to customers, or often times both.

    I hope to one day have the experience and skills to move into a full time web development role where I can work on improving that specific skill set full time.
